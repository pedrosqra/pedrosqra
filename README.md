### About me

Hey! I'm Pedro Siqueira, a Software Engineer currently working with Ruby and React on a large legacy system modernization project.

I'm really into talking about code architecture, understanding trade-offs, and diving deeper into these kinds of topics.

I'm also pretty into prompt engineering and how we interact with LLMs — even published a [paper](https://sol.sbc.org.br/index.php/stil/article/view/31135) about it. Planning to explore this more in my master's degree.

Feel free to check out my repos or get in touch.
